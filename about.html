                Hi, I'm Will Hardwick. I'm interested in a wide 
                range of communication arts, media, and technology
                and how these fields all intersect to create innovative
                and exciting products, engaging software and web 
                applications, and cohesive, refreshing brand identities 
                for businesses and professionals alike. I myself have 
                skillsets and work experience relevant to these fields, 
                such as photography for both e-commerce and promotional use, 
                social media management, creative direction, and graphic design. 
                Presently, I am primarily focused on building upon my 
                modest amount of skill and experience in web design and 
                software development in hopes to gain employment in a 
                related role.

                I'm always taking photos wherever I go. I used to enjoy doing
                staged, conceptual shoots, but recently I have been enjoying
                taking more candid and spontaneous snapshots of the people in
                my life and my travels. I also have a decent photo-book and 
                magazine collection.

                <p class="sub-head">Anything outdoors / exploring the city</p>
                <p>
                A lot of my interests and hobbies lead me to spend significant 
                time looking at screens or flipping through pages. So, I prefer
                to spend the rest of my time out in the world in some capacity.
                This may be hiking through a wilderness area, going on a picnic, 
                riding my bike, etc.

                <p class="sub-head">Listening to music</p>
                I often have music playing in the background, whether
                it be at home or in the car. However, I also love 
                to spend time digging through the discographies of 
                artists I like, artists related to them, and playlists 
                of different genres. Right now, the artists/bands 
                I have in heavy rotation are Labi Siffre, Nick Hakim,
                Jamiroquai, Sault, King Krule, and Ryuichi Sakamoto.
