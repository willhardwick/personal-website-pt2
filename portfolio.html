                    in a few different film formats to 
                    help promote a new EP project by
                    Chelsea Days, a Neo-Psychedelic band
                    in Oklahoma City.

                <p class="pg2">For five years, I have been lucky to work in a freelance
                    capacity for a retail boutique in OKC known as 
                    BY.Everyone. I've created promotional content, worked 
                    on e-commerce photography and inventory organization, 
                    and even directed special projects such as live musical 
                    performances and interviews.

                   happy to list it on here as one of my ongoing projects. I have been
                   wanting to learn more about coding, web design, and software
                   development for a few years now. I hope to slowly improve and expand
                   this website as I learn more.
